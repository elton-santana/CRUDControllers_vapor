# CRUDControllers

## Overview

Since I started dealing with REST API on my work as an iOS Developer I have the curiosity to explore the server-side world, but start it in a language with no familiarity can be a little hard. Vapor gave me the opportunity to try it out with my favorite language and I invite all Swift Developers to do the same, in a couple weeks I will come out with a tutorial to help it.

## Give a try

- [Install Vapor.](https://docs.vapor.codes/3.0/install/macos/)
- Clone the repo.
- Run following commands on repo directory:
```
    $ vapor build
    $ vapor run
```
- Use this [Postman Requests Collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/5ec6c64b3021d4370670) to try it methods.

        - It goes almost as far as I go with this project, but there are some missing informations that I intend to show later in a tutorial.
